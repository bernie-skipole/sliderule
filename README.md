# sliderule

sliderule.pdf is an article describing the maths and usage of a sliderule.

sliderule.lyx is the source document, which together with the svg images, generated the pdf file.

The article contains several illustrative sliderule scales. These were generated by the python program sliderule.py

To generate svg images create a file such as:

    import sliderule

    # create an svg image

    sliderule.multiply("image1.svg", xvalue = 2, right=True)


The function multiply has arguments:

filename is the name of the SVG file to be created

xvalue is the x value to set the rule at

right is True if setting the top rule position to the right, in which the 1 goes above the x value

or False if the top rule is moved to the left, in which the 10 goes above the x value

A typical image generated is
